# Sequential Checkpoint System Setup

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your sequential checkpoint system is now ready. Here's what was added:

### 📁 **New Files Created:**
- `scripts/checkpoint_manager.gd` - Manages sequential checkpoint activation

### 🔄 **Modified Files:**
- `Tests/test_scene.gd` - Updated to use CheckpointManager
- `Tests/test_scene.tscn` - Added CheckpointManager node

## 🎮 **How It Works:**

1. **Only one checkpoint visible** at a time (starts with the first one)
2. **When reached**, current checkpoint disappears and next one appears
3. **Direction checking** still works (from your updated checkpoint.gd)
4. **Sequential flow** ensures proper race progression

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions:**

### Step 1: Assign Checkpoints in Inspector
1. Open `test_scene.tscn`
2. Select the `CheckpointManager` node
3. In the Inspector, find the "Checkpoints" array
4. Set the array size to **10** (you have 10 checkpoints)
5. Drag each checkpoint from the scene tree into the array **in order**:
   - Array[0] = checkPoint (first checkpoint)
   - Array[1] = checkPoint2
   - Array[2] = checkPoint3
   - ...
   - Array[9] = checkPoint10

### Step 2: Test the System
- Run the scene
- Only the first checkpoint should be visible
- Drive through it in the correct direction
- Next checkpoint should appear automatically

## 🎯 **Features:**

### ✅ **Sequential Activation:**
- Only one checkpoint visible at a time
- Automatic progression through the sequence

### ✅ **Progress Tracking:**
- `get_current_checkpoint_index()` - Current checkpoint
- `get_progress_percentage()` - Race completion (0.0 to 1.0)
- `get_total_checkpoints()` - Total checkpoint count

### ✅ **Event System:**
- `checkpoint_reached(index)` - Individual checkpoint reached
- `lap_completed()` - All checkpoints completed (resets to start)
- `all_checkpoints_completed()` - Race finished

### ✅ **Direction Validation:**
- Each checkpoint still checks direction (from your previous update)
- Wrong direction = no activation

## 🔧 **Customization Options:**

### **Lap Behavior:**
Currently set to **reset for another lap**. You can modify in `checkpoint_manager.gd`:
```gdscript
func _handle_lap_completion() -> void:
    # Option A: Reset for another lap (current)
    reset_to_first_checkpoint()
    
    # Option B: End race
    # emit_signal("race_finished")
    
    # Option C: Continue to next track section
    # load_next_track_section()
```

### **Debug Functions:**
- `force_activate_checkpoint(index)` - Jump to specific checkpoint
- Progress tracking for UI elements

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Assign checkpoints** in the Inspector (Step 1 above)
2. **Test the system** with your car
3. **Add UI elements** for progress tracking if desired
4. **Customize lap behavior** if needed

The system is fully integrated and ready to use! 🎉
